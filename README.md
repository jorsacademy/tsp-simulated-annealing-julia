# Traveling Salesman Problem with Simulated Annealing in Julia

This project provides an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Simulated Annealing algorithm in Julia.

## Features

- Solves the TSP using Simulated Annealing
- Calculates the Euclidean distance between cities
- Visualizes the best tour found

## Requirements

- Julia 1.6 or later

## Installation

1. Download and install Julia from [JuliaLang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsp-simulated-annealing-julia.git
    cd tsp-simulated-annealing-julia
    ```

## Usage

To run the code, open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run Julia:

```sh
julia ex1.jl
